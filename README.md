* Open command prompt and type Python to make sure it is being recognized by the system.

### Install and Setup Pycharm

* Import this project using Github VCS.  
> Note you may need to authorize PyCharm to talk to your Github account.

### Run the program
* After you clone the project into PyCharm, in the Terminal, Enter pip install Requirements.txt
> This step should install all the libraries being used by the application, if some libraries are still missing then install them individually by going to the terminal and entering pip install {package-name}
